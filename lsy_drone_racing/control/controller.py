"""Base class for controller implementations.

Your task is to implement your own controller. This class must be the parent class of your
implementation. You have to use the same function signatures as defined by the base class. Apart
from that, you are free to add any additional methods, attributes, or classes to your controller.

As an example, you could load the weights of a neural network in the constructor and use it to
compute the control commands in the :meth:`compute_control <.BaseController.compute_control>`
method. You could also use the :meth:`step_callback <.BaseController.step_callback>` method to
update the controller state at runtime.

Note:
    You can only define one controller class in a single file. Otherwise we will not be able to
    determine which class to use.
